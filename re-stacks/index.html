      This my excavation and to<br />
      Day is Qumran<br />
      Everything that happens is from now on<br />
      This is pouring rain<br />
      This is paralyzed<br />
      <br />
      I keep throwing it down, two<br />
      Hundred at a time<br />
      It's hard to find it when you knew it<br />
      When your money's gone<br />
      And you're drunk as hell<br />
      <br />
      On your back with your racks as he stacks your load<br />
      In the back with the racks and he stacks your load<br />
      In the back with the racks and you're unstacking your load<br />
      <br />
      I've been twisting to the sun<br />
      I needed to replace<br />
      And the fountain in the front yard is rusted out<br />
      All my love was down<br />
      In a frozen ground<br />
      <br />
      There's a black crow sitting across from me<br />
      His wiry legs are crossed<br />
      He's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss<br />
      Whatever could it be<br />
      That has brought me to this loss?<br />
      <br />
      On your back with your racks as he stacks your load<br />
      In the back with the racks and he stacks your load<br/>
      In the back with the racks and you're unstacking your load<br/>
      <br/>
      This is not the sound of a new man<br/>
      Or a crispy realization<br/>
      It's the sound of me unlocking and you lift away<br/>
      Your love will be <br/>
      Safe with me <br/>
