    <p>Nikon F-1</p>
    <p2>The Nikon F camera was introduced in April 1959. This camera was Nikon's first SLR camera. Although many of the concepts for this model had already been introduced previously,  it was the first to combine these numerous concepts all in one camera! The camera was in production until October 1973 and was eventually replaced by the Nikon F2. Characteristics of its design are recognizable in all of Nikon's later SLR cameras, incling recent digital models (which still share the 'Nikon F-mount' for lenses). The "F" in the model name was derived from the term "re-f-lex", since the pronunciation of the first letter "R" is not available in many Asian languages. That naming system was carried all the way through their top line of Nikon cameras up until the introduction of the Nikon D1 (digital) cameras, where the "F" was later replaced.</p2>

    <p>Kodak Brownie Holiday</p>
    <p2>The Brownie Holiday is a small, simple viewfinder camera that uses 127 film made by Kodak. The camera was in production from 1953-1962 in both the U.S. and Canda and was designed by Arthur H Crapsey. This non-flash Brownie Holiday camera is the retail version of the Brownie Bullet, which was created as a promotionl camera. In Brazil, the same model series was manufactured for a new market and was named Camara Brownie Chiquita, Brownie Chiquita Camera and Camara Brownie Chiquita Flash. This camera was made out of plastic and was known for its tradtional brown and tan colors.</p2>

    <p>Polaroid 80B Highlander</p>
    <p2>Polaroid Model 80 (Highlander) was made from 1954-1857. This was the smallest Land camera compared to the other models of its time. The camera body is composed of steel with a brown crackle finish. It has a rigid viewfinder and the exposure is set by Light Value scale ("Polaroid numbers"). The flash is M-sync via Polaroid "hot shoe". This camera series is also known as the "Highlander". Some Model 80s have real chrome-plated trim.</p2>

    <p>Polaroid OneStep Flash</p>
    <p2>The OneStep Flash was part of the second wave of models in the Polaroid's 600 series. This model included a flip-up electronic flash to the basic design of the square. Polaroid OneStep 600 Models, on the otherhand, took disposable flash bars. The strobe flash is automatically fired when the main shutter release is pressed. At the beginning of production, these cameras did not include a close-up lens. Close-up lens were added to later models. The typical slider for exposure correction (Polaroid's Light Management System) is present. This camera was produced in tons of different colors and styles, some with added features. The Polaroid 600 Series is probably one of the more easier cameras to find. </p2>

    <p>Flexaret Twin-Lens</p>
    <p2>Flexaret cameras were made from 1939 to 1970 in Czechoslovakia by Meopta. All models of Flexaret cameras are twin-lens reflex cameras with aluminum bodies. These cameras take square "6x6" format photographs on 120 roll film. Some models were also able to use 35 mm film with the help of an adapter. The development of this camera started in the post-World War II years in the Meopta company, founded in 1946. The camera was intended for amateur photography. The Flexaret rapidly became popular in Czechoslovak households and its popularity lasted until the 1960s. </p2>

    <p>Honeywell Pentax Spotmatic</p>
    <p2>The Pentax Spotmatic Model refers to a family of 35mm single-lens reflex cameras manufactured by Asahi Optical Co. Ltd., later known as Pentax Corporation. This camera was made between 1964 and 1976. The camera allowed the user to focus the lens at maximum aperture with a bright viewfinder image. After focusing, a switch on the side of the lens mount would stop the lens and switch on the light meter. The use of stop-down light metering was at the time revolutionary, but it was limiting, especially in low light situations. "Honeywell" was the U.S. importer of the Spotmatic. The cameras imported by Honeywell were labeled Honeywell Pentax, instead of Asahi Pentax. The Spotmatic IIa was only available as a Honeywell Pentax; it was sold exclusively in the USA and had an electronic interface for specific Honeywell Strobonar electronic flash units.</p2>
