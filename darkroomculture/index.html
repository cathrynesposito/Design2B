    <p>Nikon F-1</p>
    <p2>The Nikon F camera, introduced in April 1959, was Nikon's first SLR camera. It was one of the most advanced cameras of its day. Although many of the concepts had already been introduced elsewhere, it was revolutionary in that it was the first to combine them all in one camera. It was produced until October 1973 and was replaced by the Nikon F2. Aspects of its design remain in all of Nikon's subsequent SLR cameras, through the current Nikon F6 film and Nikon D5 digital models (which still share its Nikon F-mount for lenses). The "F" in Nikon F was selected from the term "re-f-lex", since the pronunciation of the first letter "R" is not available in many Asian languages. That tradition was carried all the way through their top line of Nikon cameras until the introduction of the Nikon D1 (digital) cameras decades later. </p2>

    <p>Polaroid 80B Highlander</p>
    <p2>Polaroid Model 80 (Highlander): Made from 1954-57 and the first Land camera to be smaller in size than the other models at the time. The camera body is steel with brown painted crackle finish. It has a rigid viewfinder on top of the camera and the exposure is set by Light Value scale ("Polaroid numbers"). The shutter is a 2-speed everset rotary-leaf design (1/25 and 1/100 plus Bulb) coupled with a 100mm ~ f/8.8, 3-element glass lens. The flash is M-sync via Polaroid "hot shoe". This camera series is also known as the "Highlander". Look for some Model 80 (not all) to have real chrome-plated trim.</p2>

    <p>Polaroid OneStep Flash</p>
    <p2>The One Step Flash was the first model in the second wave of Polaroid's 600 series. It added an flip-up integral electronic flash to the basic design of the square-cornered Polaroid OneStep 600 which took disposable flash bars. The strobe flash is automatically fired when the main shutter release is pressed. Initially, there was no close-up lens. Additional models with close-up are listed here. The typical slider for darken/lighten exposure correction (Polaroid's Light Management System) is present.</p2>

    <p>Flexaret Twin-Lens</p>
    <p2>Flexaret is a brand of cameras manufactured from 1939 to 1970 in Czechoslovakia by the company Meopta. All models of Flexaret are twin-lens reflex cameras with aluminum body, taking square "6Ã—6" format photographs on a 120 roll film. Some models were also capable of working with 35 mm film with the help of a special adapter. The development of this camera started in the post-World War II years in the Meopta company, founded in 1946. The camera was intended rather for amateur photography. The Flexaret rapidly became popular in Czechoslovak households and its popularity lasted until the 1960s.</p2>

    <p>Honeywell Pentax Spotmatic</p>
    <p2>The Pentax Spotmatic refers to a family of 35mm single-lens reflex cameras manufactured by the Asahi Optical Co. Ltd., later known as Pentax Corporation, between 1964 and 1976. The camera allowed one to focus the lens at maximum aperture with a bright viewfinder image. After focusing, a switch on the side of the lens mount stopped the lens down and switched on the metering which the camera displayed with a needle located on the side of the viewfinder. The use of stop-down light metering was at the time revolutionary, but it limited the capability of the lightmeter, especially in low light situations.
    Honeywell was the U.S. importer of the Spotmatic. Cameras officially imported by Honeywell were labeled Honeywell Pentax, instead of Asahi Pentax. The Spotmatic IIa was only available as a Honeywell Pentax; it was sold exclusively in the USA and had an electronic interface for specific Honeywell Strobonar electronic flash units.</p2>
